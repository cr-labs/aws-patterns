AWS Naming and Resource-Structuring Patterns

This is a collection of AWS naming and resource-structuring patterns that I've developed and used as a platform architect and infrastructure engineer at a few places, and in my own projects. It references [crunchyroll/ef-open](https://github.com/crunchyroll/ef-open) for which some of these patterns serve as examples (but the patterns are generalizable).
